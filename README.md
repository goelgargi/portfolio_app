# portfolio_app

I build a prtfolio app using flutter.
Here are some screenshots of the screens in the application.

~~ Refer to the screenshots folders in the repository to view the screenshots of the application. ~~

The home page of the app has links to navigate to the projects page and to connect to me via LinkedIn.

The projects page lists down the projects made by me. On clicking on the project title, the github repository of the project opens up.

The icon of the app is also modified.
